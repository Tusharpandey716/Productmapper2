# Product Mapper

The **Product Mapper** is a tool designed to help users map products to predefined categories or tags. The system allows users to input product data, perform mappings, and store the information in a database for further analysis or use. It is built with **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** with **Express** for the backend. The database interaction is facilitated by a chosen database (e.g., MongoDB).
